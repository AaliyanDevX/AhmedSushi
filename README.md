AhmedSushi - First Project

Welcome to the AhmedSushi project! This is my first full project that I built as part of the JavaScript Mastery channel tutorials. In this project, I’ve created a sushi-themed website showcasing different types of sushi, drinks, and the popular Japanese cuisine experience.
Description

The AhmedSushi project is a responsive website with smooth animations, an interactive interface, and attractive UI components that I developed as a learning exercise to enhance my front-end development skills. This project is built using the following technologies:

    HTML5: For the basic structure of the website.

    CSS3: For styling and layout. It includes various CSS sections for the homepage, header, footer, and trending section.

    JavaScript: For dynamic functionality like animations, interactivity, and more.

    Vite.js: For bundling the project and optimizing the build process.

    AOS: (Animate On Scroll) is used for scroll-based animations on the page.

Features

    Trending Sushis: Displays a list of trending sushi options with their ratings and prices.

    Interactive Animations: AOS animations for smooth page transitions when scrolling.

    Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive, making it accessible on both mobile and desktop devices.

    Sushi Menu: Visual representation of different sushi types and drinks with images and descriptions.

Technologies Learned

During this project, I learned and implemented various concepts including:

    HTML and CSS fundamentals: Creating layouts and styling for web pages.

    JavaScript: Adding interactivity, DOM manipulation, and functions.

    Responsive Web Design: Using media queries to make the site work on different devices.

    Vite.js: Learning about bundling and modern JavaScript toolchains.

    Version Control with Git and GitHub: Pushing my code to GitHub and managing versions effectively.
