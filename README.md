# AhmedSushi - First Project

Welcome to the **AhmedSushi** project! This is my first full project that I built as part of the **JavaScript Mastery** channel tutorials. In this project, I’ve created a sushi-themed website showcasing different types of sushi, drinks, and the popular Japanese cuisine experience.

## Description

The **AhmedSushi** project is a responsive website with smooth animations, an interactive interface, and attractive UI components. It was developed as a learning exercise to enhance my front-end development skills. This project allowed me to explore various web development technologies and techniques.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: The basic structure of the website.
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout, with various CSS sections for the homepage, header, footer, and trending section.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic functionality like animations, interactivity, and more.
- **Vite.js**: A modern build tool that optimizes the development and build process.
- **AOS (Animate On Scroll)**: Used for scroll-based animations, enhancing the user experience.

## Features

- **Trending Sushis**: Displays a list of trending sushi options with their ratings and prices.
- **Interactive Animations**: AOS animations for smooth transitions when scrolling.

- **JavaScript**: Added interactivity, DOM manipulation, and various functions to enhance the user experience.
- **Responsive Web Design**: Used media queries to ensure the website is accessible across different devices.
- **Vite.js**: Bundled the project and optimized the build process for faster development.
- **Version Control with Git & GitHub**: Managed and versioned the code effectively.
