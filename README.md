# AhmedSushi - First Project

Welcome to the **AhmedSushi** project! This is my first full project that I built as part of the **JavaScript Mastery** channel tutorials. In this project, Iâ€™ve created a sushi-themed website showcasing different types of sushi, drinks, and the popular Japanese cuisine experience.

## Description

The **AhmedSushi** project is a responsive website with smooth animations, an interactive interface, and attractive UI components. It was developed as a learning exercise to enhance my front-end development skills. This project allowed me to explore various web development technologies and techniques.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: The basic structure of the website.
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout, with various CSS sections for the homepage, header, footer, and trending section.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic functionality like animations, interactivity, and more.
- **Vite.js**: A modern build tool that optimizes the development and build process.
- **AOS (Animate On Scroll)**: Used for scroll-based animations, enhancing the user experience.

## Features
